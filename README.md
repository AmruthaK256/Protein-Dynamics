# Protein-Dynamics

This repository contains practical exercises for exploring protein dynamics using experimentally resolved structures. 
The exercises are implemented in a Jupyter notebook (hosted on Google Colab). Youâ€™ll also find a custom **VMD `.tcl` script** to visualize and analyze atomic interactions, especially for **Section C (Distance Analysis)**.
